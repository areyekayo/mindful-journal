# Mindful Journal

## Description

Mindful Journal is a single-page React application designed to help users track their mindfulness activities and moods through daily journal entries. The app features multiple client-side routes for journaling, adding new entries, and viewing statistics about mindful minutes, moods, and activities. Data is persisted using a `json-server` backend with RESTful API endpoints. The app uses React Router for navigation and includes custom styling for an engaging user experience.

## Features

- Add journal entries with a mindful activity, duration of activity, mood, and a description
- View stats of mindful journal entries

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

Set up JSON Server:

Install json-server globally if you donâ€™t have it:

npm install -g json-server
Start the JSON server using your db.json file (make sure it contains an entries array):

json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
Run the React app:

npm start
The app will open at http://localhost:3001 and connect to your json-server.
